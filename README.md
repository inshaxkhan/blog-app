# Blog App with Node.js, Express, EJS, and Supabase
This project is a simple yet powerful blog application built using Node.js, Express, EJS, and Supabase. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, offering a smooth server-side experience, while EJS provides dynamic views for an engaging user interface. Supabase is used for real-time database management, allowing easy handling of user authentication and blog data.

## What I Learned:
Through this project, I learned how to integrate a modern stack for building web applications, utilizing the flexibility of Node.js and Express for server-side logic. Working with EJS helped me understand how to create dynamic, reusable templates. Supabase expanded my knowledge of using a serverless, PostgreSQL-based solution for database management and authentication, simplifying backend tasks while maintaining scalability and security.
